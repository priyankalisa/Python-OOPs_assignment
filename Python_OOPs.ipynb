        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a way of writing programs using objects, which combine data (like variables) and actions (like functions). It helps you:\n",
        "  - Reuse code easily\n",
        "  - Organize your program better\n",
        "  - Hide complex details (abstraction)\n",
        "  - Protect data (encapsulation)\n",
        "  - Use inherited features (inheritance)\n",
        "  - Use one method in different ways (polymorphism)\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that its objects will have.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created from the class.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only the relevant features. Achieved using abstract classes and methods.\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Hides internal state and protects data using access control (e.g., private variables with getters/setters).\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- \"Dunder\" methods are special methods with double underscores (like __init__, __str__). They enable operator overloading and define object behavior.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance means one class (child class) can use the features (like variables and methods) of another class (parent class).\n",
        "- It helps reuse code and avoid repetition.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\" — the same function or method can work in different ways depending on the object that uses it.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of how a class works and protecting the data from being changed directly.\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is done by:\n",
        "  - Making variables private using __ (double underscore)\n",
        "  - Using getter and setter methods to access or update the data\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize objects in a class.\n",
        "- In Python, the constructor is called __init__() and runs automatically when you create an object.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class Method\n",
        "  - Uses @classmethod decorator\n",
        "  - Takes cls as the first argument (not self)\n",
        "  - Can access and modify class variables\n",
        "- Static Method\n",
        "  - Uses @staticmethod decorator\n",
        "  - Takes no self or cls\n",
        "  - Acts like a regular function inside a class\n",
        "  - Can’t access class or instance data directly\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "- Python does not support method overloading directly.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own version of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "- This allows the child class to customize or completely replace the inherited behavior.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- property decorator (@property) is used to make a method behave like an attribute.\n",
        "- It is commonly used for creating getter methods, and can also be extended with @<property>.setter and @<property>.deleter to control access to private variables.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface.\n",
        "- It helps in writing flexible and reusable code, where the same method name can perform different tasks depending on the object type.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be a base class.\n",
        "- It may contain abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented.\n",
        "- In Python, abstract classes are created using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity: Code is organized into classes.\n",
        "- Reusability: Inheritance allows code reuse.\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Protects data and hides complexity.\n",
        "- Abstraction: Focuses on essential features only.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: One interface, many implementations.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared by all instances of a class. Defined at the class level.\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each object. Defined inside methods using self.\n",
        "- Class variables are used for properties common to all objects, while instance variables store object-specific data.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "This allows a child class to access the properties and methods of all its parent classes.\n",
        "- Python resolves conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object. Used by print() and str().\n",
        "- __repr__: Returns an unambiguous string for debugging. Used in the Python shell and by repr().\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- super() is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class.\n",
        "It is commonly used in inheritance, especially in constructors (__init__) to avoid rewriting code from the parent class.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- __del__ is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be deleted.\n",
        "- It can be used to release resources like closing files or network connections, but it’s rarely used because Python has automatic garbage collection.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as its first parameter. It behaves like a regular function but is placed inside a class for organizational purposes. It cannot access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "- A @classmethod takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself (not the instance). It can access and modify class variables, and it’s often used to create factory methods that return class objects.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- In Python, polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same method in different ways.\n",
        "- When using inheritance, a child class can override methods from the parent class.\n",
        "- When a method is called on an object, Python will run the version that matches the object's actual class, not the variable type.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "- Each method must return self.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method makes an object callable like a function.\n",
        "- If a class has a __call__ method, you can use object() like a function."
